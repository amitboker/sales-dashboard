# Fix 404 Error on Vercel

## The Problem
Getting 404 errors when accessing `/login` or `/dashboard` routes.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Commit and Push vercel.json
The `vercel.json` file exists but needs to be committed and deployed:

```bash
cd "/Users/amitboker/Downloads/Sales Dashboard"
git add vercel.json public/_redirects vite.config.js
git commit -m "Fix Vercel routing for SPA"
git push
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Vercel

**Option A: Auto-deploy (if connected to Git)**
- After pushing, Vercel will automatically redeploy
- Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete

**Option B: Manual Redeploy**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find project: `sales-dashboard-omega-one`
3. Click "Redeploy" button
4. Or go to "Deployments" tab and click "Redeploy" on latest deployment

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache
- Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
- Or use incognito/private window
- Or clear browser cache completely

### Step 4: Verify
After deployment completes, test:
- https://sales-dashboard-omega-one.vercel.app/ (should work)
- https://sales-dashboard-omega-one.vercel.app/login (should work)
- https://sales-dashboard-omega-one.vercel.app/dashboard (should work)

## Files Added/Modified
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Main routing configuration
- ✅ `public/_redirects` - Backup routing (Netlify/Vercel compatible)
- ✅ `vite.config.js` - Build configuration

## Why This Happens
Vercel tries to find `/login` as a file/folder. Since it's a React Router route, we need to tell Vercel to serve `index.html` for all routes (SPA mode).

## If Still Not Working
1. Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
2. Verify `vercel.json` is in the root directory
3. Check that build output includes `index.html`
4. Try accessing the root URL first: `https://sales-dashboard-omega-one.vercel.app/`
